## 🕳️ Lore Summary

*La Subterránea* is a speculative narrative universe set beneath the U.S. border wall, where a vast underground society emerges—not from rebellion, but necessity. Built initially by migrants and asylum seekers blocked from legal immigration, the tunnels were born out of desperation to escape violence, cartels, and collapsing systems above.

What began as hidden corridors gradually evolved into a thriving subterranean city-state. As more families, refugees, and outcasts joined, systems emerged—healthcare cooperatives, water filtration hubs, and salvaged engineering projects. With time, *La Subterránea* became a self-sufficient ecosystem and eventually, a viable haven.

It is not a dystopia. It is not utopia. It is a **pragmatic evolution of society under duress**—a testament to survival, adaptation, and quiet defiance.
