# Destination Pluto Idea Factory — Public Disclosures

This repository is the **public-facing archive** of ideas, specs, and creative works from the Destination Pluto Think Tank.  
It serves three purposes:

- **Freely available ideas** — concepts released under Creative Commons (often CC0) for open use, remixing, or adoption.  
- **Patent-pending disclosures** — high-level outlines of inventions with core details protected. (Contact directly if you wish to review under NDA.)  
- **Creative works** — story universes, open standards, and social-good proposals made available for public discussion.  

## Why Public?

Innovation thrives in the open. Some ideas belong to the commons, others need protection until the right partner is found.  
This repo separates the two — balancing transparency with the ability to commercialize when needed.  

## Feedback & Contributions

Feedback is welcome via Issues and Discussions.  
For deeper engagement or NDA-covered details, please reach out directly.  

## Licensing

- **Open standards & technical specs** → generally released under **CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain).  
- **Creative writing & world-building** → released under **CC-BY** unless noted otherwise.  
- **Patent-pending material** → not licensed for reuse; included here for timestamping, disclosure, and feedback only.
